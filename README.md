## Ditchling Beacon National Park Educational App Wireframe

## Overview
This project aims to create a wireframe for an educational application targeted towards children visiting Ditchling Beacon National Park. The wireframe serves as a prototype for designing an engaging and interactive app that fosters children's enthusiasm for conservation, sustainability, and the landscape.

## Project Background
The project originated from a design challenge at Open University, where the task was to develop an engaging and interactive element for Ditchling Beacon National Park. The focus was on creating a piece of play equipment, a toy or game for sale in the visitor centre, or an exhibit that children can interact with. The goal was to encourage playful engagement while addressing environmental issues and promoting awareness among young visitors.

## Purpose of the Wireframe
The wireframe serves as a visual representation of the educational app's layout, features, and functionality. It outlines the structure of the app and provides a roadmap for development. Key objectives of the wireframe include:

- Designing an intuitive user interface (UI) for children.
- Incorporating educational content related to conservation, sustainability, and the landscape of Ditchling Beacon National Park.
- Creating interactive elements to engage young users and promote learning through play.
- Establishing a foundation for further development and iteration of the educational app.

## Features
The wireframe includes the following features:

- Main Image and Title: A captivating main image and title to welcome users and set the theme of the app.

- Login Page: Secure login functionality for users to access their accounts and personalized content.
